What is the purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful. 
	- the semantic tags help name and group sections of code to aid both in css customization and accessibility for screen readers
	- the tags I use will probably depend primarily on the type of content I am creating. For websites overall, main and header/footer seem really fundamental, but if I am creating more content as opposed to website structure then I would probably use article and aside more
What is the order browsers use to display elements on a page?
	- browsers generally read/display elements in from top to bottom as they appear in the source code. This means the first thing that a browser usually reads is the contents of the head tag, then the body.
What did you learn about sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date.
	- I did not realize that you could make snippets in Sublime, and I definitely think that I will use this feature in the future. I think they will be most helpful when I want to large standardized structures like a page layouts, but then be able to customize within the set features.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	- Understanding the structure (or "rules") of the code snippet most difficult concept of the challenge for me, in part because I had no exposure to it. Also because I like to understand something fully before executing it, and I was trying to challenge myself by taking smaller steps I could understand in order to figure out the whole picture. After the session and working through the parts I feel quite comfortable with it, and I think continuing to practice/ make sample snippets will help me reinforce my understanding.
