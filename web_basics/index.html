	<h1>Some Things About Cats</h1>
	<p>I decided to make this page about <strong>CATS</strong> because the assignment suggested it as a theme. Plus, I think cats are pretty cool (<em>even though I am really more of a dog person</em>). Here are a couple things that make cats ok:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> You can name them after after anything and it makes a good name. This is not true for dogs</li>
	<li> They have furry bellies</li>
	<li> You don't have to take them on walks</li>
</ul>
<p>I think Ragdolls are my favorite type of cat (it's actually a real breed and pretty cute, <a href= http://www.catbreedslist.com/all-cat-breeds/ragdoll.html#.WJDjJrYrKu4>see for yourself</a>)</p>
