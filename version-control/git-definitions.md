# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps organizes and tracks changes to a file/ files to the developer can return to or review previous versions. Version control helps teams catch errors in code, remove or replace sections of code from previous versions and track changes made by multiple team members.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a duplicate of the project that is then changed through a series of revisions. Branching lets you make revisions without having to change the orginal. The branch can be merged back into the original (master) file/repository once the branch's task has been completed. Branching help organize the changes being made and aid in navigating versions at a later date. They also help with team work as different branches can be made for each task. When making revisions it is always best practice to work in a branch then merge back.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records changes to your version controlled files - it creates a snapshot of your work in that moment. You want to commit regularly, and particularly after making important additons or changes to your work. Making a commit lets you return to that point in your revisons at a later time. A good commit message is short and clearly describes the change made since the previous commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when you merging feature branches to eachother or to the master branch, but information was changed in conflicting ways such that Git cannot seamlessly integrate the versions as it usually would.
